# How to Test
### Wednesday, Jun 21st

## Excercise
___
Fork and clone this repository.  

Try running ruby test_robot.rb. If all is well, you should see 9 skipped tests and no error messages.
Read the code in robot.rb and the descriptions of the unit test to be implemented in test_robot.rb.
One by one, remove skip from each unit test and in its place write your test code. In the end your test output should read
```
9 runs, 9 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```
